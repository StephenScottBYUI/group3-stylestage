// You can modify the theme directly, or override some of the variables
// Overrides just need placed prior to the theme import
// For example:
// $color-primary: #3a0;

//Stephen- I have made a global index forwarding. That way when you use anything from the global all you have to do is @use 'global' and then you can use anything from the global file without having to do @use for each file in the global file. If you create a new file in the global folder just make sure to update the _index.scss file with the file. Namespace you will use for the variable is global.(variable name). See header or skip link files for examples of how this works.

@use "global";
@use "block/skip-link";
@use "block/header";
@use "block/nav";
@use "block/about";
@use "block/footer";
